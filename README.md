# herb-specimen-segmentation-benchmark

## About

This repository aims to simplify the use of the ICEDIG herbarium specimen benchmark dataset as described here:

> Dillen M, Groom Q, Chagnoux S, GÃ¼ntsch A, Hardisty A, Haston E, Livermore L, Runnel V, Schulman L, Willemse L, Wu Z, Phillips S (2019) A benchmark dataset of herbarium specimen images with label data. Biodiversity Data Journal 7: e31817. https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.7.e31817

It will provide a pipeline to download and standardise the size of the subset of specimen images which have segmentation data available. This subset contains 250 samples, of the 1800 total in the benchmark. Later steps will convert the segmentation data to a standard ML format like [COCO (Common Objects in Context)](https://cocodataset.org/#format-data)

## How to use

### Pre-requisites

You will need a `git` client in order to get the code from github. To run the software you'll need `python` installed on your local machine, and the dependency management tool `make` and download utility `wget`. See the useful links section below for resources about using and understanding the tool make.
